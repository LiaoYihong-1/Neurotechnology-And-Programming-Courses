#Algorithms And Data Structures
1. Estimate the running time of the algorithm  
2. Comparison-based sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, lower bound on sorting time)  
3. Linear time sorting algorithm (count sorting, numerical sorting, pocket sorting)  
4. Basic data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists)  
5. Algorithms based on binary heap (heap sort, priority queue)  
6. Introduction to search algorithms (binary search in ordered arrays, binary search trees)  
7. Balanced Search Tree (Balanced Tree Overview, AVL Tree, Splay Tree)  
8. Hash (Hash table with closed and open addressing)  
9. Introduction to substring search (the simplest substring search algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm)  
10. Substring search (Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, Z function, Boyer-Moore algorithm)
